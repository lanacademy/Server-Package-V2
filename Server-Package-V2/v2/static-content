There should be a symbolic link in this directory. 

ln -s /home/ted/static/content /var/www/v2/content

Remember /home/ted/static should have the permissions:
chmod -r 755 /home/ted/static/

(Permissions should already be set, but if not that should work. If it doesn't try 777, but note this is a security risk to say the least.)
